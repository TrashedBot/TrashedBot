<p>This system is developed on Ethereum, on technology 4T + F:</p>
<p>1T. "Trashed"</p>
<p>2T. "TrashedBot"</p>
<p>3T. "Trashed Token"</p>

<p>1T."Trashed" is consumption waste or production waste, such as waste items, things, materials, consumer products.</p>
<p>2T."TrashedBot" is an indispensable assistant, trained to do everything to support the Ecosystem Trashed. In the classical sense, decentralized applications, mechanisms and tools.</p>
<p>3T."Trashed Token" is a digital asset for the Ecosystem "Trashed". Token released on Ethereum, is a reward for producers, developers, investors. But with each new "Trashed" part "Trashed Token" is frozen in the "TrashedBot" fund.</p>
<p>4T."Trashed DAO" is a decentralized autonomous organization, with its ecosystem management structure "Trashed". Manages the fund TrashedBot.</p>
