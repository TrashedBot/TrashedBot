<h1>Mining Trashed</h1>
<p>"Trashed" is decentralized as production waste and consumption waste in the world.</p>
<p>"Mining Trashed" – everyone in the world has the right to extract waste production and waste consumption to maintain the network "Trashed", making the world a better place.</p>
<p>In the world there is a practice of collecting "Trashed" such as paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, metals. There is even a practice of collecting milk, dairy farms.</p>
<p>In adolescence with friends, I had to collect metals on spontaneous dumps. Which was handed over in points of reception of metals. But the metal was as a raw material "Trashed". Not the metal that is the value as a product, for example, the fence metallic perimeter.</p>
